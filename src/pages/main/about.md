I care about code and crafting the best user experience. With over a decade of professional knowledge I have a keen ability to approach development projects with a clear vision and am able to deliver tailored solutions to clients, with the purpose and end user firmly in mind.

Historically focused on frontend development, I am proficient at building user interfaces and tools using modern JavaScript frameworks such as React. I also specialise in making responsive websites/apps that help people achieve both aesthetic goals and meet business critical targets, including providing added value to customers and end users. I embrace CSS (SCSS / CSS-in-JS) and utility first libraries such as Tailwind and make sure projects are accessible in multiple environments.

With considerable experience in design, I am able to articulate complex ideas visually and communicate them effectively, using modern tools to illustrate interactive ideas or using wireframe software to plan prototypes. I often start lo-fi, with coloured pens and a white board, moving to tech-based solutions as ideas develop.
